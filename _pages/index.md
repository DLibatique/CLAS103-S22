## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the literature of ancient Greece, from roughly the 8th century B.C.E. to the 2nd century C.E., a span of almost 1,000 years. We will read works of various genres of Greek literature in translation, with authors and works including Homer, the lyric poets, Herodotus, Greek tragedians, Aristophanes, the Attic orators, Hellenistic poetry, and the Greek novel. The goal is to gain a basic understanding of the progression of Greek literature and how each work or genre relates to social and political conditions in Greece at the time, especially with regard to gender and interpersonal relationships.
