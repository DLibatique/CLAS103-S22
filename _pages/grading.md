## Overview

Grading and assessments in this course will be unorthodox. Your semester grade will be a combination of **specification assignments** (responses and creative projects) and **quantitative assessments** (quizzes and exams).

* **Specification assignments** will receive a **satisfactory** or **unsatisfactory** grade, rather than a numerical or letter grade, and your semester grade depends in part on how many satisfactory grades you accumulate in that category. Each specification assignment will have an explicit set of guidelines and criteria for what will be considered “satisfactory.”
* **Quantitative assessments** will be scored traditionally (e.g., 8/10 points on a quiz, 95/100 points on an exam), and the sum of points in the quizzes category and the exams category dictate your semester grade in combination with the other requirements.

**You will be in control of your semester grade** — you decide the grade that you want and commit as much time and energy towards that grade as you desire.

The following is a rubric for semester-end grades in this course.

| | **D** | **D+** | **C-** | **B-** | **A-** | **A** |
| -----: | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Responses** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| **Creative Projects** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| **Quizzes** | 20 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 115 |
| **Exams** | 120 | 130 | 150 | 160 | 170 | 180 |

To achieve a certain grade level, you must complete the listed number of satisfactory assignments or requirements from each of these four categories. For example, if you want a **B-** for the semester, you must complete 8 responses to secondary readings and 2 creative projects, and you must have earned at least 80 points across all 12 quizzes and 160 points over the midterm and final (see details below). When you have completed the minimum number of requirements for the final grade that you want, you do not need to submit further examples of that assignment type.

Once you have reached either the **C-** or **B-** range, you can improve within that letter range (e.g., from a B- to a B or a B+) by meeting the criteria in the next grade level in any one or two fo the following categories: quizzes, responses, or creative projects. The completion of **one** improves your semester grade from a minus to the regular letter; the completion of **two** improves your semester grade from the regular letter to a plus; the completion of all **three** moves you to the next letter range if your midterm/final grades allow it.

For example, a student in the B- range can move to a B by earning 20 more points on quizzes. The student can then improve to a B+ by completing another creative project in addition to earning the quiz points. If the student then completes two more responses and scores at least 170 points over the midterm and the final, then the student earns an A- for the semester!

It is possible to make up **unsatisfactory assignments**. At the beginning of each semester, each student will be allotted **three (3) tokens**. One token can be used to make up an unsatisfactory response or to retake a quiz, and three tokens are required for another attempt at an unsatisfactory creative project. The midterm and the final may not be revised or retaken unless exigent circumstances warrant it; this will be decided on a case-by-case basis at my discretion.

No late assignments will be accepted without documented permission. I strongly encourage you to be proactive in reaching out to me if you anticipate not being able to make a deadline; it is far preferable to set up an extended due date than for you to ask for an extension after the fact!

## Responses

This requirement asks you to respond to secondary articles, chapters, podcasts, or videos that treat the literary, cultural, and historical topics that we’ll be discussing in class. Items to which you can respond are designated with “**(RESPONSE)**” in the course schedule. You are encouraged to write responses to items that deal with a topic in which you are particularly interested for any given week. So, for example, in Week 5, we will discuss symposium culture and lyric poetry, and one element of the conversation will be the Greek poetess Sappho. If you’re particularly interested in her, you should write a response to Ella Haselswerdt’s Eidolon piece, “Re-Queering Sappho.”

You may submit up to **one (1) response per week**, defined as the period from one Saturday at 12am to the next Friday at 11:59pm. See [Canvas](https://hc.instructure.com/courses/5725) for the windows of availability for each response. If you miss a response deadline, you will not have the opportunity to make it up later unless you use a token, so please plan accordingly and be proactive in informing me if you think you’ll miss a deadline.

Your response should be written in one of three formats: **3-2-1**, **argument analysis**, or **personal reflection**. All three formats should generally be **1-2pp. double-spaced**. The response will be graded satisfactory if it answers each prompt or question under the appropriate heading below:

### 3-2-1
* Write down **three (3)** things that you learned.
* Write down **two (2)** things that you found interesting and want to learn more about.
* Write down **one (1)** thing that was unclear or one question that you still have about the material.

(Note: a 3-2-1 does not need to be written in paragraph form; you can use bullet points or numbered lists.)

### Argument Analysis
* Answer the following questions:
    * What is the author’s main argument?
    * How do they make that argument? What evidence do they provide?
    * Do you agree or disagree? Or, put differently, does the author make their case persuasively?

### Personal Reflection
* If the article speaks to you on a personal level (in terms of lived experience, personality traits, political affiliation, etc.), what resonates with you? How can you connect the topics or ideas in the article to events, relationships, or beliefs in your own life? (Disclaimer: see “Mandated Reporter” section of the course policies above.)

Every response should include: 1) your name and the date of submission; 2) the type of response you’re writing; and 3) the author and title of the item to which you are responding. Feel free to copy and paste the item information from the course schedule.

All responses should be submitted to the appropriate resopnse prompt via our [Canvas page](https://hc.instructure.com/courses/5725) as a .pdf or .docx file. If you use Google Docs or Apple Pages, please save your response as a .pdf and upload that.

## Creative Projects

I will designated a number of possible projects for you to complete that will draw on your creativity. The possibilities for projects are linked [in the Creative Projects page](creative-projects) of this site. The tasks range from writing poetry to creating artwork, recording a podcast to recording a video, analyzing an object to making a pitch to a journal to creating a playlist. If you would like to complete a creative project that isn’t listed in the possibilities on the course website, you are more than welcome to pitch your idea for a creative project to me via email or in student hours.

**You are allowed to submit only one (1) of each type of creative project**. That means that you can, for example, submit a poem, and artwork, an object analysis, and a meme/Tiktok compilation as your four creative projects if you are aiming for a semester grade of A. You cannot submit, for example, four poems, or two poems and two artworks.

Each creative project should be submitted to [Canvas](https://hc.instructure.com/courses/5725), and you can look to [Canvas](https://hc.instructure.com/courses/5725) for the deadlines for each project. If you miss a deadline, you will need all three tokens to submit a creative project in that slot unless you have received an extension from me beforehand.

## Quizzes

Throughout the semester, there will be **twelve (12) quizzes, each worth 10 points**, designed to test each week’s material. Each quiz will be open-note and open-resource and available through Canvas. The format for each quiz can be any combination of the following question types: multiple choice, fill-in answers, matching (e.g., authors to names of works, events and dates, etc.), or term definitions.

Please note:
* All quizzable material will be drawn from the slideshows.
* There will be a **10-minute time limit** for each quiz.
* To begin each quiz, you will need to input a **passcode** that I will share at the end of every Thursday’s class.

Twelve quizzes at 10 points each comes out to a possible maximum of **120 points** throughout the semester. Each quiz grade that you receive will be added into a running tally for the semester, and the final sum will correspond to a semester grade as explained in the rubric above.

I purposefully write the slideshow terms without much detail, and the definitions and explanations that I will provide in class cannot be found through Google searches or the like. It behooves you to take good notes, study constantly, and contact me with any questions about terms as they arise. Make sure to have a buddy in class from whom you can get notes if you are absent on a given day.

## Exams

There will be **two (2) open-note, open-resource exams** in this course, a midterm that will cover the first half of the course and a final that will cover the second, though questions on the final may ask you to compare concepts from the latter half of the course with those from the former half. Each will be graded out of **100 points** and formatted like larger quizzes (i.e., with similar question types) with some modifications (e.g., fill in the blanks with a word bank) and additions (e.g., short answers). The short answers may ask you to compare two passages that we’ve read during the semester, to describe cultural institutions or literary genres, etc. The maximum possible exam point total for the semester, then, is **200 points**, and like the quizzes, your midterm and final grades will be tallied and factored into your semester grade according to the rubric above.

Both the midterm and the final will be administered via [Canvas](https://hc.instructure.com/courses/5725).
